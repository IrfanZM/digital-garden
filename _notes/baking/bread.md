title: Bread
---

The starting point for my all bread exploration.

1. [[The regular bread recipes]], tried and tested
2. Experimental bread recipes, in the works and still need tweaking/practice
3. Untried bread recipes, that I want to try but haven't yet
4. Bread theory, the science behind the bread

My goal at the moment is to have the following nailed down:

- Standard, quick white bread and wholemeal bread
- White sourdough
- Rye sourdough
- A dessert bread/cinnamon roll kind of thing
- 3 or 4 "fancy" breads
  - Including a braided bread
