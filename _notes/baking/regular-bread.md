### Ingredients

- 500g strong white flour
- 325g (ish) warm water
- 10g salt
- 7g instant yeast

### Stage 1 (mixing)

This assumes that I'm making the recipe in a stand mixer with a dough hook.

1. Mix the yeast in a small bowl with some of the warm water, and let sit for a few minutes.
2. Mix flour and salt together.
3. Add all the yeast to flour. Start mixing whilst slowly adding water until all incorporated.
4. After about 5-10 minutes of kneading in the mixer, finish it off by hand to get the kneaded consistency required.

### Stage 2 (proofing)

1. Let proof for about an hour.
2. Tip out onto work surface, and shape.
3. Place into banneton/loaf tin, proof for an hour (but you'll have to switch on the oven in about half an hour).

### Stage 3 (baking)

1. Turn on oven to around 210Â°C, half an hour into the second proof. Make sure baking tray/stone etc. is in.
2. After the second proof, place dough on baking surface, and score the dough's surface however you want (typically one line across the surface).
3. Bake for around 30-40 minutes, chuck in some water in the oven if you want to create steam and nicer crust. Final result should be a nice golden brown, and bottom of loaf should be hollow.
4. Remove bread and place on cooling rack. Don't let it sit in its  own steam! Let it cool for a decent amount of time, as it's still cooking.

### Other notes

- This bread uses a 65% hydration ratio. I've found this works well for a decent crumb texture without a dough that is too difficult to handle. Depending on how it's looking after kneading in the mixer, I sometimes push it up to a 70% ratio (by adding another 25ml of water).
- Interestingly, I think the achievable hydration ratio is very affected by the hardness of the tap water. Since moving out of London, I think it has been far easier to make high hydration bread.
