Some other photos from the same Ilford HP5 roll as the [[Summer at Regents Park, 2019]] gallery, this time in a couple of different lighting conditions.

This first one is actually one of the first buildings I helped design when I was an engineer. I visited it soon after it opened, and it was amazing to see the drawings, brick bond and concrete designs coming to life. It was an extremely sunny day, so I did struggle a bit with exposure and contrast, but this is my favourite shot capturing the rear of  the building, its stepped back terraces and showcasing some of the different brick bonds.

Nearby is the lovely [Skoob books](https://skoob.com/), a second-hand bookshop in Bloomsbury underground - well worth a visit.

A couple shots of the Brighton Pavilion from a day trip we took there.

I included this shot as an example indoor shot at a wedding I attended. Being at night and indoors, it was another challenge to get good exposures, so many of the photos didn't turn out great.

Finally a couple of shots from Cambridge, the first being the oculus skylight at Fitzwilliam Museum, where I was seeing how well I could capture that skylight, but also the intricate details just inside (not so successfully as it turns out). The second is from the new Cambridge mosque - where the lighting conditions were  actually great, but I just didn't spend enough time finding a good composition. The architectural styling of the main hall is calming and gentle, with a great sense of space that has been created.
