title: Snowday in Watford, 2021
---

In January of 2021 we had a huge snowfall here in Watford (that sadly lasted only a few days). I tried shooting some photos out in the snow, but it was a real challenge getting the exposures right with all the white that was in the frame. It was also a challenge compositionally, trying to get some nice points of interest in the shot when nearly everything was just plain white.

For these shots I used some expired Kodak Ultramax 400, which I also developed myself using some developer that was also very close to expiring, which is why I think some of the other non-snow shots in this roll came out pretty grainy and with some funky colours.

For the next three shots below, my scanning software and I really struggled with getting consistent white balances across the shots without ruining the exposure and losing details. Something to put on my list to improve on in future!

This isn't my favourite shot, but it does illustrate the scale of the snow that fell on that day, a real contrast to what the park normally looks like.

I really like this iconic cedar tree in Cassiobury Park.
