title: Isle of Wight, 2018
---

This was a small trip me and my family took in 2018 after Eid to the Isle of Wight. Sadly I don't have the fondest memories of the holiday as I got really bad food poisoning, either from some dodgy fish or dodgy sauce that accompanied the fish.

Anyways, there were some nice photos that I got from Godshill Model Village below, and was really great weather. Film stock was Fuji Superia X-TRA400. I found that the film really shines in bright sunlight.

On the same film stock, a couple of pictures from baking, from my early days when I was starting to experiment with bread.
